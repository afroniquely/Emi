Emi Starter Theme
===========================

This is a clean WordPress starter theme cobbled together from a variety of resources over multiple years. Emi is intended to be used as a starting point for other WordPress themes, it is not meant to be a stand-alone theme in itself.


Set Up
------------
I use [String Replacer](http://www.tensionsoftware.com/osx/stringreplacer/) (a Mac app) to find and replace the following strings, keeping the same general format as shown:

`emi_theme` > `theme_name`

`emitheme` > `themename`

`Emi Theme` > `Theme Name`

Then, add a screenshot and you're ready to start!


Changelog
------------
* 0.1 Updated theme name and added structures for SASS
