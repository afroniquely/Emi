WordPress Starter Theme
===========================

My "blank" WordPress starter theme, such as it is. Based on Twenty Eleven and a bunch of other resources and code snippets.


Set Up
------------
I use [String Replacer](http://www.tensionsoftware.com/osx/stringreplacer/) (a Mac app) to find and replace the following strings, keeping the same general format as shown:

`twenty_eleven` > `client_name`

`twentyeleven` > `clientname`

`Twenty Eleven` > `Client Name`

Then, add a screenshot and you're ready to start!
